Requirements
============

.. note::
    
    This section is under construction.

**PRISM requires BAM file of RRBS reads, aligned by Bismark.**

PRISM strictly requires mapping results of Bismark, a bisulfite read mapping tool. Also note that PRISM only applies to RRBS data, and unfortunately, the feasibility of PRISM to the data from other methylation profiling techniques such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq), or methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture sequencing (MBDCap-Seq) has not been verified.
